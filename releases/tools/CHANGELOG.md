# Host Tools changelog

This ledger owns Host Tools. The published baseline at the split is 0.76.1,
from the [original joint integration release](../integration/CHANGELOG.md#0761---2026-11-01).
Joint history through 0.76.1 remains there once, with its original scope.

## [0.76.2] - Unreleased

### 🔧 Changed

- Release Host Tools and the Testkit family independently in the existing workspace.
  Select `RELEASE_GROUP=tools` for this group; package versions and public
  contracts are unchanged. Existing integration journals retain their original
  source, policy and recovery context. ([#299](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-tooling/issues/299))
